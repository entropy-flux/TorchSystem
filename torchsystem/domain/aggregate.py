    An AGGREGATE is a cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for the purpose
    of data changes. Each AGGREGATE has a root and a boundary. The boundary defines what is
    inside the AGGREGATE. The root is a single, specific ENTITY contained in the AGGREGATE and
    provides the IDENTITY of the AGGREGATE. The root is the only member of the AGGREGATE that
    outside objects are allowed to hold references to.

    In deep learning, an AGGREGATE consist not only of a neural network, but also several other
    components such as optimizers, schedulers, tokenizers, etc.  For example, a transformer model
    is just a neural network, and in order to perform tasks such as text completion or translation,
    it needs to be part of an AGGREGATE that includes other components like a tokenizer. The AGGREGATE
    is responsible for coordinating the interactions between these components.

    Attributes:
        id (Any): The id of the AGGREGATE ROOT. It should be unique within the AGGREGATE boundary.
        phase (str): The phase of the AGGREGATE.
        events (Events): The domain events of the AGGREGATE.

    Methods:
        onphase:
            A hook that is called when the phase changes. Implement this method to add custom behavior.

        onepoch:
            A hook that is called when the epoch changes. Implement this method to add custom behavior.

        ```python

        The identity of the AGGREGATE ROOT.

        In Domain-Driven Design, the AGGREGATE ROOT is the single entry point 
        to a cluster of domain objects, and its identity uniquely distinguishes 
        the AGGREGATE within its boundary. This property returns that identity.

        Key points:
            - Immutable once assigned to preserve AGGREGATE consistency and invariants.
            - Accessing the ID before initialization raises an error to prevent 
            unsafe operations on an uninitialized AGGREGATE ROOT.
            - Ensures that all domain operations relying on identity are deterministic 
            and safe.

        hashes of components). Once set, the ID is immutable to uphold the AGGREGATE's 
        invariants and consistency rules.

        Some domain operations require that the AGGREGATE ROOT has a valid identity

        This method allows the domain logic to verify readiness safely.

            If the `id` property is overridden in a subclass (e.g., computed dynamically
